# READ ME

This is a self-made reminder bot for discord, because I refuse to pay money for one. I have also set this repository up 
for the purpose of allowing people to do the same should they choose to do so. I simply ask that you do not use this code
to set up a for-profit version of the bot, because that's scummy.

## Application Properties

In this repo there is `blank-application.properties` file that mimics the structure of my `application.properties`. This
is so you can easily set up a version for yourself by filling in the blanks and renaming the file. I'm not including the
base `application.properties` file as I don't want to accidentally commit any sensitive information.

## Environment

In this repo there is a provided `environment.yml` file that is compatible with Conda and will provide the necessary
dependencies to run this project automatically by executing `conda env create --file environment.yml`.

## Running the Application

Run main.py after having added all the dependencies and setting up the bot in the Discord Developer Portal.
